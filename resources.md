A living list of references that help me level‑up:

* **Courses**
  * [InvokeRE](https://invokere.com/) -  Intro to Malware Binary Triage (IMBT) by Josh. How I began my very first journey. 
  * [Zero2Automated](https://www.0ffset.net/training/zero2auto/) - An advanced course to Malware Analysis. I heard it's really good and this is going to be my next one. It's even certified by Chuong Dong (the gold standard in MA).
